# Side-Projects
Just random things I decided to write during my free time

## Battleship:
-Originally written in CPP (original code lost). Rewritten in C#
-The classic board game "Battleship" written as a console app

## NumberGuesserConsoleGame
-Basic game where one player chooses a number and the other tries to guess
-Allows for computer and user to play either role (chooser or guesser)

## TextFileEncoder
-Some thought I had about shifting the values of each byte in a text file to obscure the original contents
-User specifies offset and new file is written with each byte shifted by that offset

## TestingGround
-Various little custom functions that may be useful at some point
### Framerate Stabilizer
-Can be used within a main loop to force a specific run speed for a program
### FileExtensionRenamer
-As the implies, contains a few methods to give files different extension types
-Includes recursive renamer to give all files within a directory and its subdirectories a different extension
