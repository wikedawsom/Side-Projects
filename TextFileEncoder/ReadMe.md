This program reads a file and adds or subtracts 1 from each byte of data.

This is a crude encoder idea I had when I saw that the .NET Core "File" class had a GetAllBytes() function.

One day, I might reuse this idea but allow a user defined shift, or maybe a more advanced encryption method, to make it more difficult for third parties to decode the files.
